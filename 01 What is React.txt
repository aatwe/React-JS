What is use of React? Build user interfaces for website and web apps
			website + User Interface =>  interactive website
			Best Web framework after jQuery

What is React? JS Library for building user interfaces
		Breaks down complex UI into component tree

What is reused and customized ? components			

What is component? html + css +js	-> each component is functional
	Create several components
	Each component -> different function + different appearence


Why use component tree? simplifies structure of website	
		Earlier Navbar : Lots of html 
		in react Navbar = <Navbar> Component	-> becomes an html element
		Keeps code clean and reusable and modular

Ex of component in use?
	Twitter website -> when scroll bottom of feed
			how new tweets load
			without entire page updating/reloading
			Detect if user at bottom of screen -> make request to server -> populate feed component with more data

	FB -> pop up notif on fb friend request -> Had to refresh to see
		notification component -> listens to change in server -> update itself
		FB entire made of components
			news feed, post(update itself), chat

How does component updates itself?	
	Comparing changes
	If change happens => compare new DOM tree to  Old DOM Tree
			Spot the difference
			Update only the changed components
			Web app becomes interactive
			Web app becomes faster 

Why use react? Clean code
		Earlier Navbar : Lots of html 
		in react Navbar = <Navbar> Component	-> becomes an html element
		Keeps code clean and reusable and modular

	Makes easy and fast to build user interfaces: AirBNB
	Helps to build repetitive units
		Building single component and then customize
		
		for ex individual stays on airbnb
		Each stay different 
		parameters work same though
