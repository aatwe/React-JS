2 ways of styling
1) JSXX Attributes
2) Inline Style
______________________
JSX Attributes

Objective 1
Summary: How to target classes? specify in css and apply in JSX using className attribute
	 How to target ID?
	 How to target HTML elements directlyl? normal css
		for ex ul {color: blue'}

What are elements? <div>

	We are using html elements in JS using JSX
		How to style these html elements
How to change h1 color to red
1) add class attribute name as heading
	.heading {
 	  color; red;
	}
WARNING1
What problem -> Console -> Invalid DOM property class
We know the ReactDOM is rendering html to JS
it cannot understand class, in js we have classname
	React has solved for you by understanding  and considering class 

2) 1) add class attribute className as heading
	.heading {
 	  color; red;
	}
WARNING2 : Cannot understand angle bracket <>
Why? Browser cant understand <>??
	Browser doesnt know this is jsx file(html + js) and not normal JS file

How to tell browser this is JSX?
In index.html
  //How we add js as script 	in html file? provide source and type
    <script src="../src/index.js" type="text/javascript"></script>		//the type is text file with jS code
								//our file is text but not JS file -> it is jsx file

    <script src="../src/index.js" type="text/JSX"></script>		//Change to JSX
//Warning solved

What writing convention for HTML inside JSX? follor JS -> camel case
Why camel case is imp? if not camelcase: -> html wont work in JSX
